### Project Description
CAV Rank is an account-based website that allows users the ability to review and search different concerts, artists, and venues while connecting with other music enthusiasts. 

### Motivation
Who wants to go to a bad concert? As music enthusiasts, we think an application where users can connect with each other and review different concerts is invaluable. CAV Rank helps users see the most enjoyable artists, while promoting the concert experience. 

### Risks
1. Our team is inexperienced with web technologies and services
2. Underestimation of time needed to complete project requirements
3. Relatively inexperienced with relational database design and implementation

### Mitigation Strategy for Risks
1. Develop skills as needed (ex: Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML)
2. Look at our past projects and assignments for similar concepts
3. Get advice from peers on helpful resources for learning technologies
4. Use Agile Methodologies and organization of features to help plan the time needed to complete requirements
