### Project Description
CAV is an account-based website that allows users the ability to review concerts and search different concerts, artists, and venues while connecting with other music enthusiasts. Users can follow artists, look at photos and videos of concerts, or search different venues to help them decide on different events to attend. The goal of CAV is to unite the different aspects of the concert experience in the ease of an internet browser.

### Motivation
Who wants to go to a bad concert? As music enthusiasts, we think an application where users can connect with each other and review different concerts is invaluable. CAV helps users see their most enjoyed artists, while promoting the concert experience. 

### Risks
1. Our team is inexperienced with web technologies and services
2. Underestimation of time needed to complete project requirements
3. Relatively inexperienced with relational database design and implementation

### Mitigation Strategy for Risks
1. Develop skills as needed (ex: Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML)
2. Look at our past projects and assignments for similar concepts
3. Get advice from peers on helpful resources for learning technologies
4. Use Agile Methodologies and organization of features to help plan the time needed to complete requirements
